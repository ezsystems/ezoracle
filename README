Requirements
============

The following requirements exists for using eZ Oracle extension:

o  eZ Publish version:

   Make sure you eZ Publish version [EXTENSION_PUBLISH_VERSION] or higher, earlier
   versions will not work correctly with this extension.

o  Oracle version:

   Make sure you have Oracle 9, 10 or 11 (client and server).

   If the Oracle server version is less than 9.2, setting the environment
   variable NLS_LANG is mandatory to indicate that php expects to receive
   data from the database in the UTF8 character set.

o  PHP with Oracle support:

   Make sure your PHP installation has compiled in support for Oracle. To
   compile this you will need the Oracle client libraries and headers.
   The standard windows version of php includes the dll needed for oracle support
   (but the oracle client is still needed).

o  Oracle user with correct permissions:

   Make sure you have a user on the oracle server that can create the
   following elements: session, table, trigger, sequence and procedure.
   It should also have quotas set appropriately for the amount of content
   to be created.
