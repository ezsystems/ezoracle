eZ Oracle extension 2.1.0 INSTALL

Introduction
============

1. What is the eZ Oracle extension?
   --------------------------------

   This extension adds support for the Oracle database to eZ Publish by
   plugging into the database framework. After it is installed you can
   connect to any Oracle database that fits the minimum requirements.

2. License
   -------

   This software is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0. The complete
   license agreement is included in the LICENSE file. For more information
   or questions please contact info@ez.no

3. Requirements
   ------------

   The following requirements exists for using eZ Oracle extension:

   o  eZ Publish version:

      Make sure you use eZ Publish version 4.4.0 or higher
      together with this extension.
      It is generally recommended to always use the latest stable version of
      eZ Publish when running on Oracle.

   o  Oracle version:

      Make sure you have Oracle 9, 10 or 11 (client and server).

      If the Oracle server version is less than 9.2, setting the environment
      variable NLS_LANG is mandatory to indicate that php expects to receive
      data from the database in the UTF8 character set.

   o  PHP with Oracle support (oci8 extension):

      Make sure your PHP installation has compiled in support for Oracle. To
      compile this you will need the Oracle client libraries and headers.
      The standard windows version of php includes the dll needed for oracle support
      (but the oracle client is still neded).
      To check if Oracle support is enabled, the output of the phpinfo() php
      function includes a section titled "oci8". From the command line run `php -i'

   o  Oracle user with correct privileges:

      Make sure you have a user on the oracle server that can create the
      following elements: session, table, trigger, sequence and procedure.


Getting eZ Publish
==================

You can download a version of eZ Publish from ez.no, you will find the
various versions at:
http://ez.no/download/ez_publish/ez_publish_4_stable_releases

NOTE: You will require eZ Publish 4.4.0 or higher

Information on the installation of eZ Publish can be found at:
http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual


Restarting Apache
=================

   Detailed instructions on the installation and configuration of the oci8
   extension are available at http://www.php.net/manual/en/oci8.setup.php.

   Possibly you will have to restart the Apache webserver to make sure PHP is
   loaded with Oracle support and the needed enviroment variable are in effect.

   $ . oraenv
   $ apachectl restart

   NOTE: Each time you restart the webserver you might need to run the `oraenv'
         command, if not the Oracle extension in PHP will not work properly.


Installing eZ Oracle extension
==============================

1. Copy or untar the package into the `extension' directory in the root of your
   eZ Publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution.

   $ unzip ezoracle-2.1.0.zip

3. Enable the extension in eZ Publish. To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the
   folder root_of_ezpublish/settings/override. If this file does not exist, create it.
   Locate (or add) the block [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:

   ActiveExtensions[]=ezoracle

   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the sites should use
   the extension, make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezoracle

   Regenerate the extension autoload file, either via GUI (in case the  eZ Publish
   site is already installed ) in the Admin interface, "Setup" tab, "Extensions" page,
   or by executing the ezpgenerateautoloads.php file.


Initializing Oracle database
============================

1. Automated install with ora-initialize.sh
   ----------------------------------------

   Go to the eZ Publish installation directory and run the script:

   $ ./extension/ezoracle/bin/sh/ora-initialize.sh

   The script will check your system against the requirements. If something
   is not as it should be it will give you information on the problem.
   The script will ask for some information in some steps, the steps are:

   o  Testing connection to Oracle server

      This step will check if the Oracle server can be connected to using PHP.
      Running this step is recommended since it will give information on what
      can be done if it fails.

      The following information will be asked for:

      Username: Which user to connect with
      Password: The password for the user
      Instance: The name of the oracle instance, this must match the instance
                configured on the client. If you are unsure about this you can
                use the one set in the ORACLE_SID environment variable.

   o  Create a new user

      This step can create a new user with the required privileges for you.
      This is the user that will be the owner of the eZ Publish objects (schema).
      If you already have a user with the required privileges you can skip
      this step.

   o  Connecting to Oracle server

      This step will read in information which will be used to connect to the
      server in later steps. The specified user must have the required
      privileges.
      Note: This step will be skipped if a user is created in the step above.

   Once the script has all necessary information it will connect to the server
   and initialize the Oracle database.

   o  Creating md5_digest and bitor functions

      The extension requires custom procedures in the database to handle
      md5 strings and bit operations. Your user will require `CREATE PROCEDURE'
      privilege for this.

   o  Cleaning up existing elements in database

      If eZ Publish has been previously installed it will remove any elements
      left.

   o  Creating the database schema and inserting data

      The schema and data will be taken from the eZ Publish installation files
      and initialized in the database.

2. Manual install
   --------------

   Suppose you have a running Oracle instance named "orcl" which you can access
   as user "scott" with password "tiger", and you want to run eZ Publish on it.
   Here are several steps to achieve this goal:

   o  Environment variables

      Set all the needed environment variables by eg. running `oraenv'.

      $ . oraenv

      (you may need to consult with your DBA to know which SID to enter)

   o  Setup a database user:

      You must make sure you have a user with the correct privileges

# Here user "system" (DBA) has password "sys".
#################################################################
$ cat <<EOF | sqlplus system/sys@orcl
CREATE USER scott IDENTIFIED BY tiger QUOTA UNLIMITED ON SYSTEM;
GRANT CREATE    SESSION   TO scott;
GRANT CREATE    TABLE     TO scott;
GRANT CREATE    TRIGGER   TO scott;
GRANT CREATE    SEQUENCE  TO scott;
GRANT CREATE    PROCEDURE TO scott;
EOF
#################################################################

      You will see "ORA-01920: user name 'SCOTT' conflicts with another user
      or role name" if user scott already exists.
      If the Oracle server is version 10g or later, new users might be created
      with a default tablespace which is not SYSTEM; you should alter the above sql
      command accordingly to grant unlimited quota on the correct tablespace
      (and possibly specify a customised default tablespace for the user)

   o  Create md5_digest and bitor functions

      The extension requires custom procedures in the database to handle
      md5 strings and bit operations. Your user will require `CREATE PROCEDURE'
      privilege for this.
      $ sqlplus scott/tiger@orcl < extension/ezoracle/sql/md5_digest.sql
      $ sqlplus scott/tiger@orcl < extension/ezoracle/sql/bitor.sql

   o  Initialize the schema

     The schema must now be created with all the tables, sequences and
     triggers for eZ Publish. Then the schema must be filled with data.
     Here you have two choices:

     1. Start from scratch
        ------------------

        You can start from scratch by using the schema bundled with the
        eZ Publish installation, and filling it with the basic data.

        o  Create the schema
           $ ./bin/php/ezsqlinsertschema.php --type=oracle --user=<user> \
               --password=<password> \
               share/db_schema.dba <instance>

        o  Insert data
           $ ./bin/php/ezsqlinsertschema.php --type=oracle --user=<user> \
               --password=<password> --schema-file=share/db_schema.dba \
               --insert-types=data \
               share/db_data.dba <instance>

     2. Migrate from existing MySQL database
        ------------------------------------

        This step is as automated as possible. Ideally, you should only run
        these scripts to transfer your MySQL DB schema and data to Oracle:

        1. mysql2oracle-schema.php
        2. mysql2oracle-data.php
        3. ora-update-seqs.php

        Run each script without arguments to see its usage.
        Here is a sample scenario:

        $ cd extension/ezoracle/bin/php/
        $ ./mysql2oracle-schema.php corporate_34:root/@heaven:3400 \
            > corporate_34.sql
        $ sqlplus scott/tiger@orcl < corporate_34.sql
        $ ./mysql2oracle-data.php corporate_34:root/@heaven:3400 \
            scott/tiger@orcl
        $ ./ora-update-seqs.php scott/tiger@orcl


Configuring eZ Publish
======================

1. Changing eZ Publish database handler

   Before eZ Publish will start using the Oracle database, the current
   database handler must be changed.

   Edit your settings/override/site.ini.append.php and make sure the
   DatabaseSettings section contains the following information:

##################################
[DatabaseSettings]
DatabaseImplementation=ezoracle
User=<user>
Password=<password>
Database=<instance>
##################################

   You must replace `<user>' `<password>' and `<instance>' with the user and
   instance you use to connect to Oracle.
