eZ Oracle extension 2.1.0 FAQ

Connection problems
===================

Please refer to the online php manual at www.php.net to find more information
about configuring your php server to connect to an Oracle database. A lot of
valuable information is contained within the users comments.

The first step to see if the Oracle support is activated in php is to check the
output of the phpinfo() php function, or to run `php -i' on the command line. If
it is, a section titled `oci8' will be present. When php is compiled in a modular
fashion (as on windows), remember to enable the oracle extension in the php.ini file.

The second step is to have a simple php script connecting to a known database.
This way you can make sure that all the environment variables needed by the
Oracle client are properly set up and accessible to the php process.

If you cannot connect to the database, Oracle provides useful command-line
utilities to troubleshoot connection problems: tnsping, sqlplus, lsnrctl.
Please refer to the Oracle documentation for more information about those.


Oracle errors
=============

If you receive some Oracle error codes it may be related to these issues.

   ORA-12162 or OCI_INVALID_HANDLE
   -------------------------------

      ORA-12162: Error while trying to retrieve text for error
      or
      ocilogon(): _oci_open_session: OCIHandleAlloc OCI_HTYPE_SVCCTX:
      OCI_INVALID_HANDLE in
      extension/ezoracle/ezdb/dbms-drivers/ezoracledb.php on line 68

      Most probably it meens that you haven't set ORACLE_HOME environment
      variable before starting Apache.

      Set it manually:
      $ export ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1 # or whatever
      or with oraenv script coming with Oracle:
      $ . oraenv
      and then restart Apache in the same terminal:
      $ apachectl restart


   ORA-12545
   ---------

      Most likely the server is not listening on incoming requests or has a badly
      configured instance.
